**Note that these SDKs are currently in preview and are subject to change.**

## Fogwing IoT Simulation for Python
This repository contains the following sensor's code:
* [DHT11 Sensor](https://github.com/factana/fogwing-simulator-for-raspberry-python/tree/master/fw-iothub-dht11-sensor)
* [Sample Message](https://github.com/factana/fogwing-simulator-for-raspberry-python/tree/master/fw-iothub-sample-message)
* [Soil Moisture Sensor](https://github.com/factana/fogwing-simulator-for-raspberry-python/tree/master/fw-iothub-soilmoisture-sensor)

## Installing the libraries
Install all required libraries using pip with our requirement.txt file that is stored in all sub folders of this repository.
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Run and Get Started with Fogwing IoT
Change the client_id, username and password with your Fogwing IoTHub access credentials after which you can run your file with the below command.
```
python file_name.py
```
provided everything goes well you will find a message that reads successfully published in the command line.
